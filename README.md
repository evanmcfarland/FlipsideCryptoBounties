# FlipsideCryptoBounties

Flipsidecrypto.xyz is a open data platform for major blockchians.

People use it to solve solve bounties, or business intelligence problems for blockchains that help them grow and retain users or answer other interesting questions about how their chains are used.

I use R/Python instead of native SQL for most of their solutions so I'll track them here, but the links to the more visually appealing portfolio set can be found on the first line of uploaded scripts or on my profile: https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/evanmcfarland
